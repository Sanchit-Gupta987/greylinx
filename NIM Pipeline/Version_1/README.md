# Version 1 of the NIM pipeline. 
- This uses Llama 3.3 70b which is a much more powerful model, and also reacts differently with each prompt.
- Created a whole new application with multiple preset analysis and the option to perform custom analysis
- Specific to this version of the database. For a different version of the database a few changes will be needed
    - Change of context document
    - Change of prompts and pipeline since its customized for the very specific times of the current subset of data I am performing testing with.
