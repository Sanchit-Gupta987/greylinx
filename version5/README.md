# Version 5
- Made some improvements to prompts.
- Used new non-depreciating chaining format.
- Set temperature (randomness) for the LLM to 0 to get more factual, consistent, and predictable responses.
- Removed all mention of "SS_ID" column from the general context document (not needed + causing confusion)
- Other small changes
